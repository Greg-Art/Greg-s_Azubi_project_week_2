# Greg-s_Azubi_project_week_2
This is my first excel project using pivot tables. 
In this week, we learned how to use the relevant graphs to represent a dataset 

In this project, I analyzed the National Park Services (NPS) dataset and I was tasked to figure out the following:

1. How many people visited different parks in Colorado state?

2. Justify the choice of your Chart in question 1

3. What are the top 10 states with most visitors?

4. Justify the choice of your Chart in question 3

5. With the aid of a chart, what is the mean value of all visitors?

6. Create ONE chart showing the visitor trend over the years for Boston African American Park. In your own words, please describe the trend according to the chart you created.

7. Create a different worksheet named Maps and plot all the states against their total number of visitors on a graph.
